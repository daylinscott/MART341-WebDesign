# Assignment 11 Daylin Scott
1. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?
System fonts are already installed on your computer, but are not always available to everyone on the web while a web font is a custom font hosted on a server and doesn't have to be installed on a users device to appear. However, because neither of these are 100% reliable, we also have web safe fonts which can be counted on for availability for both Mac and Windows.
2. What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
It is important to have a fallback font so that if the original font you have chosen is not compatible with a user's browser, it can still be replaced by the font chosen for the fallback.
3. Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and what you
did to overcome them.
I felt that I did pretty well with this assignment, there is some weird spacing between the first line of each paragraph, but I think that may just be due to the drop cap. I'm getting more of a feel for the relationship between CSS and HTML and felt more confident in this assignment than the last one.

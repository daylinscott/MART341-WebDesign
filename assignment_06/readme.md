## How many main head and body elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?
A page should have one main head and one main body element. The head sets up the fundamentals of the page, the style, and the name of the site that shows up in the browser, while the body contains most of the actual content in the site, such as photos or text.


##  Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.
From what I understand, structual markup is sort of the outline of any given code, like the headers and the paragraghs, while semantic markup is more of a tool to use within structural markup, for things such as fonts, deffinitions, or quotes.


## My Work Cycle
I had a pretty easy time with this assignment, aside from getting the image to show up in the browser. It seems so self-explanatory and I know just like last week, there must just be one small thing I'm missing, but I can't figure out what it is. I was able to fix the image from last week's assignment after you responded to my email so I'm hoping you can lookl over this code and let me know what I'm doing wrong image wise. I have also been working on my site and will set up a meeting with you in a few days. Thank you for your patience!

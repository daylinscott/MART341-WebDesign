# Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve?
Most of the forms I come across when I am browsing the web are very simple, such as search bars, or forms to fill out my information when I am ordering something online.

# List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and their usage.
The text input creates a box for the user to type in information to submit to the browser, this can be used to type in contact information or feedback on various sites. The selection input is sort of like a multiple choice from, giving the user a select few options to choose from, an example of this would be when you are sopping online and they ask you to select Visa or Mastercard for payment. The button input is usually an interactive graphic that the user can click on to submit something or take them to a different page.
# Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
I felt like there were a lot of things in this assignment that I was not very familiar with and I felt a little overwhelmed at first, but as I got further into it I realized that it wasn't that hard if I just took it step by step. The course website was a very helpful work-along for this particular homework. This was also the first time I had ever done a table believe it or not, so that was exciting.

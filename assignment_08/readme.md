# Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans
Id's are a unique identifier to a specific element in html, class groups similar types of elements together using the same name value, divs create an element to block other elements together and are used to increase structural clarity, and last but certainly not least are spans which are used within divs to provide more organization and/or extra styling.

# Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using a service like YouTube or Vimeo to host your videos?

I had some initial trouble wrapping my head around all of the new concepts introduced this week, but after going over the course module a few more times, things became more clear and the assignment was fairly easy.

I cannot stress how much I appreciate the conciseness of the instructions for this class, it makes everything so much easier.

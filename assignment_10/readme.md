1. Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When
might you choose one over the other to style content?
The univeral selector selects every element to style on a page, while an element selector selects specific types of element on a page to style such as only h1 type elements. A class selector is used to select elements that serve the same function throughout the page by using class ID's so you can easily apply the same style to different divs throughout your page. An ID selector is used to style particular elements by using their particular ID, which is good if a style only occurs once.
2. Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, RGB
values, or hex codes.
The colors I chose for this were yellow (for the text background), pink (for the page background), and purple and green for the text. I just wanted to have fun with some bright colors on this page since it's themed in "the 80's".
3. Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them.
I had a lot of trouble with trying to position the image elements the way that I wanted to, I tried to do it on the CSS page, but I couldn't get it to work so I ended up doing it on the index.html.

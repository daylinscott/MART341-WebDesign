# Assignment 9 Daylin Scott
1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or
difficult to learn?
This has been somewhat of a review for me, but I had forgotten a lot of things, and there are some things we didn't ever go over last time I took this class. It's been really good for me to have this class this semester to hold me accountable to practice and go over HTML so it will be fresh in my mind when I graduate.
2. Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us
"decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in
this new section?
The relationship between HTML and CSS has always been something that I have a hard time wrapping my head around, but the thing that I am most interested in about web design is the aesthetic, so I'm glad that we will be getting more into it so I can gain a better understanding.
3. Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes. What did you do to
overcome your challenges?
I had a little bit of trouble with this assignment, I felt very overwhelmed at first and was frustrated that it wasn't looking the way I wanted it to, but I broke it down into smaller segments and was able to get most of everything that I wanted accomplished. I apologize that I have fallen behind the past few weeks, I will be caught up shortly.

# Assignment 12 Daylin Scott
1. What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?
A margin is the amount of space around an element while padding is the space between the element and the text inside of it. Borders are the decoration on the edges of the element (lined, dotted, dashed, etc).

2. Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them.
I actually had a lot of fun with this assignment, there were some things with 'display' that I had trouble with, but I just kept trying things, and eventually got there after viewing your example code for this week, which was very helpful!

1. Visit a site using The Wayback Machine, looking at a snapshot at least 10 years old. Where did
you go? What did it look like? How has it changed?
2. Summarize your experience with these last few topics. What did you learn? What was difficult,
easy, or still misunderstood?
3. An embedded image of your screenshot using its relative URL.

      <p>Once upon a time on the edge of a great forest, there lived a very poor woodcutter with his wife and his two children, Hansel and Gretel. His second wife often ill-treated the children and was forever nagging the woodcutter. The family had little enough to eat, and once there was a great famine in the land the man could no longer even get them their daily bread. “There is not enough food in the house for us all. There are too many mouths to feed! We must get rid of the two brats,” she declared. And she kept on trying to persuade her husband to abandon his children in the forest.</p>

     <p>“Don’t worry! If they do leave us in the forest, we’ll find the way home,” he said. And slipping out of the house he filled his pockets with little white pebbles, then went back to bed.All night long, the woodcutter’s wife harped on and on at her husband till, at dawn, he led Hansel and Gretel away into the forest. But as they went into the depths of the trees, Hansel dropped a little white pebble here and there on the mossy green ground. At a certain point, the two children found they really were alone: the woodcutter had plucked up enough courage to desert them, had mumbled an excuse and was gone. Night fell but the woodcutter did not return. Gretel began to sob bitterly.Hansel too felt scared but he tried to hide his feelings and comfort his sister.
“Don’t cry, trust me! I swear I’ll take you home even if Father doesn’t come back for us!” Luckily the moon was full that night and Hansel waited till its cold light filtered through the trees. The moon was shining bright as day, and the white pebbles glittered like new silver coins.</p>
